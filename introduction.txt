Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Ingride. I am a student who is passionate about business, entrepreneurship, and creating opportunities that can make a positive impact. I enjoy learning new ideas, exploring different business strategies, and working on projects that help me grow professionally and personally.

I created this file as part of my GitHub learning task, and I look forward to gaining more knowledge and improving my skills as I continue this journey.
